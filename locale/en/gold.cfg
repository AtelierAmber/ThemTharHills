[mod-setting-name]
themtharhills-initial-gold=Gold generates in starting area
themtharhills-se-maintenance=Enable Space Exploration maintenance recipes
themtharhills-enable-aqua-regia=Enable aqua regia

[mod-setting-description]
themtharhills-se-maintenance=Particle accelerators and similar buildings from Space Exploration will sometimes need replacement advanced cables. Does nothing if If I Had A Nickel's SE maintenance option is also enabled, as advanced cables are a component of electromagnets.
themtharhills-enable-aqua-regia=If Krastorio and/or BZ chlorine are installed, gold processing requires both nitric acid and hydrogen chloride. If this setting is enabled, they must first be mixed together into a single fluid, which makes routing the acids to the gold processors themselves considerably easier and more compact. If disabled, the old behavior persists.
